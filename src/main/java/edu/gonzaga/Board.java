// this file will contain the board class
// it will create and manage spaces, keep track of where each player is,
// and determine the next space based on the given card color/symbol

// some attributes/methods we want is:
// spaces: List<Space> (actual game board)
// players: List<Player> (players on board)
// setBoard() : initializes the board
// getNextSpace(String color): finds the next space to match card
// movePlayerToken(Player p, Space s): moves the player across board
// getSpace(int index): get the space by position on board

// note: this class should interact with both space and player classes?
